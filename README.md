## General info

It took me a while to figure out how to create this previous/next looping navigation pattern for a subsection in [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) so I thought I'd share. This is part of a side project converting my portfolio website to the Hugo static site generator framework from WordPress and is intended to be used as a partial, for example in a sidebar area on a project page so users can navigate project examples in a carousel manner.
